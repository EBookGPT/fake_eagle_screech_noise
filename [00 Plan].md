Please provide me with the input you want me to insert. I need the text you want me to use in place of "INSERT_INPUT_HERE" to be able to complete your request. 

For example, you could say:

"INSERT_INPUT_HERE is the outline I provided in my previous message."

Or:

"INSERT_INPUT_HERE is the following text: [Insert the text you want me to use here]" 

Once I have the input, I can proceed with generating the full outline for your fiction book "Fake Eagle Screech Noise" based on the critique and your instructions.
